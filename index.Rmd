# There are some components of my websites: 

* Links for my email, github page and linkedin are in the navigation bar.

* Here's the page that briefly introduces my [academic and professional experience](about.html)

* Here's a page of a [flexdashboard](dashboard.html) using plotly. The codes that I used to create the plot can be found [here](plotly.html). There are three charts in the dashboard:
  + A line graph, showing the inspection score trend throughout 2017 by borough. 
  + A bar chart, showing the number of Italian restaurants in different borough with grade A in 2017. 
  + A box plot, showing the inspection score in each borough in 2017.
