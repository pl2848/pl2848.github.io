We're going to make some plotly plots.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
```


```{r}
library(plotly)
```



```{r}
data("nyc_inspections")

head(nyc_inspections, n = 100)
```




```{r}
nyc_inspections_italian = 
  nyc_inspections %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(cuisine_description == "Italian")

head(nyc_inspections_italian, n= 100)
nrow(nyc_inspections_italian)

unique(nyc_inspections_italian$grade)
```


Plotly scatterplot: This scatter plot shows the distribution of Italian restaurant with grade A.
```{r}
nyc_inspections_italian %>%
  filter(grade == "A") %>% 
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Name: ", dba)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~latitude, y = ~longitude, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~boro,text = ~text_label,  alpha = 0.5)

```


```{r}
# Plotly barchart: This barchart shows the number of Italian restaurant with Grade A in different Borough.
nyc_inspections_italian %>% 
  filter(grade == "A") %>% 
  count(boro) %>% 
  mutate(boro = fct_reorder(boro, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~boro, y = ~n, color = ~boro, type = "bar", colors = "viridis")
```


```{r}
# Plotly boxplot: This boxplot displays the scores in each Borough. The higher the score, the more severe of the violations.
nyc_inspections_italian %>% 
  mutate(score = as.numeric(score),
    boro = fct_reorder(boro, score)) %>% 
  plot_ly(y = ~score, color = ~boro, type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```
